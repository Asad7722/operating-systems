Process Synchronization
===

#### Background
- Cooperating processes may either directly **share a logical address space** or
be allowed to **share data through files**.
- Concurrent access to shared data may result in **data inconsistency**:
  - Processes are interleaved in time (single processor system)
  - Processes are interleaved and overlapped (multi-processor system).
- Consider a simple example of procedure “echo” which takes input from the
keyboard and display it:
  - Two processes calling the procedure simultaneously.
- Maintaining data consistency requires mechanisms to ensure the orderly
execution of cooperating processes – **Process Synchronization**

#### Critical section problem and solutions
- **Bounded buffer example**
  - Suppose that we wanted to provide a solution to the consumer-producer
problem that fills **all** the buffers. We can do so by having an integer
**counter** that keeps track of the number of full buffers. Initially, **counter**
is set to 0. It is incremented by the producer after it produces a new buffer
and is decremented by the consumer after it consumes a buffer.
- Race condition
  - The situation where several processes access and
  manipulate shared data concurrently.
  - The final value of the **shared** data
  depends upon which process finishes last.
  - To prevent a race condition, concurrent processes must be **synchronized**.
    - Ensure that **only one process** at a time is manipulating the variable counter.
  - The statements (1 line of C code may consist of multiple instructions)
  `counter++;` or `counter--;`
  must be performed **atomically**.
  - **Atomic operation**
    - an operation that completes in its *entirety without interruption*
- **Critical Section** (**CS**) Problem
  - n processes all competing to use some shared data
  - Each process has a code segment, called **critical section**, in
  which the shared data is accessed.
  - Problem
    - How to ensure that when one process is executing in
  its critical section, no other process is allowed to execute in its
  critical section.
    - Execution of critical sections by the processes is thus **mutually
  exclusive**.
  - Solutions
    - Software, hardware, OS and high-level constructs
- Solution requirements
  - **Three requirements**
    1. **Mutual Exclusion**
      - If process Pi
     is executing in its critical section, then no
    other processes can be executing in their critical sections
      - *One each time*
    2. **Progress**
      - If no process is executing in its critical section and there exist
    some processes that wish to enter their critical section, then the selection
    of the processes that will enter the critical section next cannot be
    postponed indefinitely
      - *Decision must be made*
    3. **Bounded Waiting**
      - A bound must exist on the number of times that other
    processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has
    made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is
    granted
      - *Everyone has a chance to get in eventually*
      - Assume that each process executes at a nonzero speed
      - No assumption concerning relative speed of the N processes
- CS kernel problem
- A kernel code is subject to several possible race conditions
  - Kernel data structure that maintains a list of all open files in the system
  - Other structures for maintaining memory allocation, for maintaining
process lists, and for interrupt handling
- **Non-preemptive kernel** – runs until exits kernel mode, blocks, or voluntarily
yields CPU
  - Essentially free from race conditions
- **Preemptive kernel** – allows preemption of process running in kernel mode
  - is *not* free from race conditions
  - It allows a process to be preempted while it is running in kernel mode
  - Preemptive kernels are used in real-time systems, Linux 2.6 kernel,
Solaris
- Two-process solution
- Bakery algorithm
