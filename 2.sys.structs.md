Operating-System Structures
===

#### OS components
- Process management
- Memory management
- File management
- I/O system management
- Secondary-storage management
- Networking
- Protection

#### OS Services
- **User interface**
  - Command line interface (CLI)
  - Graphical user interface (GUI)
  - Batch
- **Program execution**
  - The system must be able to load a program
into memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally
or abnormally (indicating error)
- **I/O operations**
  - A running program may require I/O, which may
involve a file or an I/O device
- **File-system manipulation**
 - Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, search them, list file Information, permission management.
- **Communication**
 - Processes may exchange information, on the same
computer or between computers over a network
  - shared memory or through message passing (packets moved by the OS)
- **Error detection**
  - OS needs to be constantly aware of possible errors
  - May occur in the CPU/memory hardware, in I/O devices, in user program
  - For each type of error, OS should take the appropriate action to ensure
correct and consistent computing
  - **Debugging** facilities can greatly enhance the users and programmers
abilities to efficiently use the system
- **Protection and security**
  - The owners of information stored in a multiuser or
networked computer system may want to control use of that information,
concurrent processes should not interfere with each other
    - **Protection** involves ensuring that all access to system resources is
controlled
    - **Security** of the system from outsiders requires user authentication,
extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts
- **Resource allocation**
  - When multiple users or multiple jobs running
concurrently, resources must be allocated to each of them
  - Many types of resources
    - CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O
devices
- **Accounting**
  - keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of
computer resources

#### User OS interface
- Command line interface (CLI)
  - CLI or **command interpreter** allows direct command entry
  - Sometimes implemented in kernel, sometimes by systems program
  - Sometimes multiple flavors implemented – **shells**
  - Primarily fetches a command from user and executes it (fork/execv)
  - Sometimes commands built-in, sometimes just names of programs
    - If the latter, adding new features doesn’t require shell modification
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
  - User-friendly **desktop** metaphor interface – PCs, Tablets?
    - Usually mouse, keyboard, and monitor
    - **Icons** represent files, programs, actions, etc
    - Various mouse buttons over objects in the interface cause
    various actions (provide information, options, execute function,
    open directory (known as a **folder**)
    - Invented at *Xerox PARC* – not Apple
- Many systems now include both CLI and GUI interfaces
  - Microsoft Windows is GUI with CLI command shell
  - Apple Mac OS X is Aqua GUI interface with UNIX kernel
  underneath and shells available
  - Unix and Linux have CLI with optional GUI interfaces (CDE,
KDE, GNOME)

#### System calls and their types
- Syscalls is the interface for User *programs* to talk to the OS
  - Programming interface to the services provided by the OS
  - Typically written in a high-level language (C or C++)
- OS resources are mostly accessed by programs via a *high-level*
**Application Program Interface (API)** rather than direct syscall use
- Three most common APIs (often in form of libraries)
  - Win32 API for Windows
  - POSIX API for POSIX-based systems (UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X)
  - Java API for the Java virtual machine (JVM)
- Why use APIs rather than system calls?
  - easier, more portable
- Parameter passing
  - Three general methods used to pass parameters to the OS
    - **Register**
      - Simply pass the parameters in registers
      - In some cases, may be more parameters than registers
    - **Memory block**
      - Parameters stored in a block, or table, in
    memory, and address of block passed as a parameter in a
    register
      - This approach taken by Linux and Solaris
    - **Stack**
      - Parameters placed, or pushed, onto the stack by the
    program and popped off the stack by the operating system
    - *Note: Block and stack methods do not limit the number or
  length of parameters being passed*
- Five categories of system calls
  1. **Process control**
    - create process, terminate process
    - end, abort
    - load, execute
    - get process attributes, set process attributes
    - wait for time
    - wait event, signal event
    - allocate and free memory
    - Dump memory if error
    - Debugger for determining bugs, single step execution
    - Locks for managing access to shared data between processes
  2. **File management**
    - create file, delete file
    - open, close file
    - read, write, reposition
    - get and set file attributes
  3. **Device management**
    - request device, release device
    - read, write, reposition
    - get device attributes, set device attributes
    - logically attach or detach devices
  4. **Information maintenance**
    - get time or date, set time or date
    - get system data, set system data
    - get and set process, file, or device attributes
  5. **Communications**
    - create, delete communication connection
    - send, receive messages if **message passing model** to
    **host name** or **process name**
      - From **client** to **server**
    - **Shared-memory model** create and gain access to
    memory regions
    - transfer status information
    - attach and detach remote devices
  6. **Protection**
    - Control access to resources
    - Get and set permissions
    - Allow and deny user access
    - *Not one of the 5 major*
- Examples
    - System call sequence to copy the contents of one file to another file
      - `% cp <source file> <destination file> `

#### Communication Models
- **Message passing model**
  - Information is exchanged through inter-process
communication facility provided by OS.
- **Shared memory model**
 - Processes use map memory system calls to gain access to regions of memory owned by other processes.

#### System programs

#### OS design and implementation
- Mechanisms and policies

#### OS structure
- Monolithic
- Layered
- Microkernel
- Modules
- Virtual machines

#### OS generation and boot
